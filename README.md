# git-jira
> minor python function to extract Jira ticket number and add to git commits

## What?

Imagine that you have a branch with name **[place_holder]-1234** and you always forget to put the ticket number in your commit message?

Now, no more!

## How?

Add a new alias to your zsh/bash/fish:

```bash
alias git-jira='[path_to_script]/git_commit.py'
```

Now just use it as you would with *git commit*.

```bash
~/[some_path]$ git-jira "commit message" 
```

OR

Add an alias to your git global configuration:

```bash
~/$ git config --global alias.commit-jira '!python3 /[path_to_script]/git-jira/git_commit.py'
```

And the usage:

```bash
~/[some_path]$ git commit-jira "commit message"
```

And voil√†!
